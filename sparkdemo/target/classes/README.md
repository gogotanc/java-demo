# Abstract

Deep learning has become one of the most promising directions in the field of machine learning, and has made breakthrough achievements in many aspects such as speech, vision, text and so on. Deep learning is different from traditional neural network, it does not use the "shallow" network, but choose a very deep network structure. These nonlinear neurons, when properly trained, can represent extremely complex features in the data to achieve good recognition or classification.

Classification of data patterns generated by handwriting characters, photograph pixels, audio signals  has long been a popular topic in machine learning field. We used to take advantages of the non-volatile feature of computer memory so as to create huge database to afford data searching and pattern matching mechanism. However, we are expecting machines behave more closely to human beings and instead of merely remembering, they could be capable of observing, learning, analysing and recognizing just as human beingsâ€™ behavior when they come with an unfamiliar object.
